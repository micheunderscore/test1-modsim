# Modelling & Simulation Test 1 Submission

## My Details

- **Name :** Muhammad Iqbal bin Asim
- **Matrix ID :** 18001179
- **Batch :** Computer Science

## Getting Started
1. Run 
```bash
$ python math-class-reg.py
````
2. Enjoy simulation
3. CSV file should be generated at the end of the simulation.

## Business Case

This simulation could be used to improve productivity within the university that it is
employed in as it allows for each tutor to entertain any number of students effectively within a
limited group size occupying their individual queues. The data retrieved from this simulation
can then also be used to show that some tutors are left idle with no students to tend to at certain
hours. This might give insight to which factors are affected by the number of specialized tutors
available and the specific topics.

## Simulation Details

This simulation is based off the assumption that each tutor can only entertain a limited
number of students at a time. Each student is given time to provide their question and be
addressed. Each tutor and student are paired based on their specifically assigned topic/specialty
and can only interact with each other exclusively. The time is then incremented as each queue
is finished and each tutor satisfies their consultation period within the hour. Within this period,
the number of students who have occupied their queue has also been recorded. The statistics
of which will be compiled at the end of the simulation into an easily accessible .csv file which
will be generated.

### THE PROJECT REPO WILL BE PRIVATED UPON SUBMISSION

I will include your (Sir Nordinâ€™s) e-mail within the direct access list for the project repo to
lessen the chances of my classmates finding this repo. :)
